====== WELCOME TO ====== ===== DIVINE JOURNEY ===== A modpack by Atricos::1
"An Adventure and a Challenge in one" - would be the best way to describe the Divine Journey modpack. Modpacks like FTB Infinity Evolved Skyblock and Project Ozone 2 inspired me to create it, which are also modpacks that include modified recipes through MineTweaker.::0

::0
Divine Journey, as well as the ones listed before, have a direct line of progression through all installed mods, and at the end, have a way of crafting otherwise uncraftable items - Divine Journey makes almost all Creative Items available for crafting. To achieve this, it will be even more difficult than normally, because recipes are expensive and hugely rely on other mods.::0
::0
::0
The goal of the modpack can be explained in a couple words: ::0
"Make Infinite Infinity Ingots."::3
- achieved by first making one, and putting it into a Creative Strongbox.::0
::0
::0
::0
Divine Journey, the name, came from DivineRPG, one of the included mods. In order to accomplish your goals, you will need to travel through all of DivineRPG, as well as some other exploration oriented mods and dimensions, like Runic Dungeons, Twilight Forest, the Deep Dark, the Eldritch Dimension, the Dream World, Torment's Maze, and RFTools Worlds.::0
::0
And this book will be your guide through the journey. If you're unsure about a specific mod, or don't know how to progress, look up the point you're at in this book by the achievement section to find out what the next step is.::0
This pack currently features 2 modes, easy and hard (default is hard). To switch between the modes, use::0
"/ftb_mode set easy" or "/ftb_mode set hard".::3
::0
You will need to automate almost everything to be able to progress further, and you've been given the tools to do so.::0
You can gather resources using VeinMiner, AgriCraft, MagicalCrops, the Builder, the Ender Quarry, and RFTools Dimensions.::0
You can Autocraft and Autoprocess with Applied Energistics 2 and automate everything with Thermal Expansion, EnderIO, MineFactory Reloaded, Botania, RFTools, Extra Utilities, and so on.::0
It's possible to simply progress through the modpack by just looking at Creative recipes and the Infinity Ingot recipe in NEI, and check the progression to get there.::0
Under certain items in NEI, I included Tooltips, especially by DivineRPG items that drop from bosses or are required to progress through the dimensions.::0
This book contains information about your progression, in the form of a quick summary (next 2 pages), and in the form of checkable achievements (rest of the book). If you ever lose this book, it is craftable, using a book and two purple dyes.::0
