But once you collect enough Nether Stars to make a Dire Crafting Table, you will be able to fly like you were in Creative! This chapter is also useful for material collecting. Make a Builder and a Shape Card (Quarry) as your first type of Quarry. Use Tesseracts to transfer power and items between your ME System and your Quarry and store items you get from it in Storage Drawers connected to a Drawer Controller, which you can hook up to a Storage Bus to see all the items that the drawers contain in your ME System. Later you can make an Ender Quarry and travel into the Deep Dark for much more ores and faster mining, and you\u0027ll be able to upgrade it with Speed, Silk Touch or Fortune. Definitely don\u0027t skip these useful gadgets!",
